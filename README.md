# SwipedMicroservices
- Swiped! is a real-time e-bidding system that provide real-time bid update to clients.
- This project is still in progress and is separated from my cloud and distributed system project submission repo

System Design

How does bidding work
- User submits a bid
- New bid's price must be higher than current bid (Read)
- New bid replaces the current bid (Write)

Scalability: Issues with concurrent bidding system
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/177de970-40e1-4565-9444-c552b32bbe28)

Scalability: Concurrency
- ConcurrentDictionary
   - Key: AuctionId 
   - Value: Semaphore
- Each AuctionId is assigned to 1 semaphore
- Store the locks and provide row based locks
- Other auctions are not locked

Scalability: Concurrency
- Additionally, need to process the lifecycle of the semaphore 
   - Ebay - 1.7 billion active listings
- If auction is not in use, dispose semaphore 
   - Else Dictionary will contain too many semaphore 
- Problem is similar to reader and writer problem
   - If bid is in use, reader +1 
   - If bid is not in use, reader -1
   - If reader == 0 (write)
      - Dispose semaphore

Scalability: Consistent Hashing
- In order to scale the bidding service in parallel. Consistent Hashing needs to be implemented to load balance bid request based on the auctionId
   - Uses a ring-based structure to assign nodes and data based on hash values
   - Bid requests will be hashed and placed on the ring, and sent to the nearest server on the ring structure
- This ensures that no 2 of the bid request with the same auctionId is processed at the same time to ensure concurrency

Scalability (In-Memory Database / Caching)
- Calling DB over a network is expensive
- Use ConcurrentDictionary to cache bids
- MS-SQL as a persistent storage
   - Primary Source of Truth
   - Strong Consistency
- Decorator and Cache-Aside Design Pattern was used for implementation

Real-Time Bidding Updates (Broadcast Real-Time Communication)
- Real-Time bidding update is implemented using SignalR and event-driven design
   - BidUpdate Request send from 1 client toÂ bidding microservice
   - Bidding service publishes the event to the event bus
   - Bidding Update service then consumes the event from the event bus
   - Bidding Update service then broadcast bid updates to clients based on auctionId (topic)

CQRS + Mediator Pattern
- Logical Separation of read and write
   - Implemented in conjunction with the Vertical Slicing Architecture
   - Auction Service
      - GetAuction
      - CreateAuction
- Physical Separation of read and write
   - Implemented as a separate microservice with separate DB for optimization
   - Bidding Service and Bidding Update Service
   - Bidding service 
      - Source of truth (WriteDB)
   - Bidding update service
      - Read Projections (ReadDB)

Asynchronous communication
- Domain Events are adapted to Integration Events
- Event handlers publish integration event into message queues
   - RabbitMQ
   - MassTransit
- Publish and Consume Integration Events using Pub / Sub Pattern

Job Scheduler Service: Hangfire
- Background Jobs & Workers Service
- Consumes the AuctionCreatedEvent
- Uses the EndingDate of the auction to schedule jobs
   - Publish the AuctionEndedEvent

Distributed Caching - Redis
- High Read (132 Million active buyers)
- Cache time consuming operation like the O(n) of 
   - getAuctions, 
   - getAuctionByCategory
- Allows parallel services to have access to a distributed cache for faster reads
- Use Decorator and Cache-Aside Design Pattern for implementation

Cross Cutting Concerns
- Mediator design pattern
   - Validation Pipeline behavior
   - Logging Pipeline behavior
- Global Handling Exceptions
- Health Check
   - Check if the current service is healthy
   - GET: {{service-url}}/health
